To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Clone this project by typing ```git clone git@github.com:saimaAnis21/TheAthleticGraphQL.git```
- cd into the root directory
- Run git pull origin main
- Simply install the `node_modules` (I use yarn) and start the server. Feel free to use a node version manager (e.g. https://github.com/tj/n) if that helps.
